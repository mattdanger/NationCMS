ABOUT NationCMS

A mostly object oriented PHP based content management system that I wrote. It is loosely named "NationCMS" because that is the name of the site I wrote it for. It was written to work with PHP 4.2 and MySQL. It was my first attempt towards a more "Web 2.0" site and included the following features:

- Object Oriented codebase
- Partial template engine with custom 404 and 403 error pages.
- Blog w/ RSS feed
- User profiles
- Photo & video uploading and hosting
- Full administrative backend with user access controls
- Clean URLs using Apache's mod_rewrite module
- All forms have input validation and MySQL insert filters
- Usage and error logging
